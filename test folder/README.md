# Working with Tidy Tools for Time-Series data


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to tidy tools for time-series data. Time-series data is a time-ordered sequence of observations, which is very common in practice. The three packages (1) Tsibble, (2) Fable and (3) Feasts provide tools and solutions to handle this kind of data in the different core steps of the data science workflow.

The slides of the presentation can be accessed [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/flixi67/secret-tidy-tools/main/05-tidy-tools-for-time-series-data-kube-reichardt-bareddy/presentation/Presentation.html).


### Main learning objectives

Example: The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the dplyr package and data wrangling workflow, (2) show you the three key verbs of the pacakge, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.

## Tutorial

The session is accompanied by a tutorial, which can be accessed [here](Placeholder for raw githack link, requested by Simon).
